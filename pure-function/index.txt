Q.What is Pure Function?
Ans.
"A pure function is a function that has two main characteristics:
It always produces the same output for the same input. In other words, it is deterministic.
It does not cause any side effects â€” it does not modify any external state or variables, and it doesn't rely on any external data that could change outside the function."
