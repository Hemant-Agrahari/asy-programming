1.JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time. However, it needs to handle asynchronous tasks like fetching data from an API or reading from a file without blocking the rest of the code from running.

The event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple asynchronous operations without blocking the execution of other code. Here's how it works:

Call Stack: When functions are invoked, they're added to the call stack. The JavaScript engine executes each function in this stack one by one.

Web APIs: When asynchronous operations are called (like setTimeout, fetch, etc.), they are handled by Web APIs (provided by the browser or environment like Node.js) and are offloaded.

Callback Queue (or Task Queue): Once an asynchronous operation completes, its callback function is placed in the callback queue.

Event Loop: The event loop constantly checks the call stack. If the stack is empty, it moves the first callback from the callback queue to the stack for execution.

Execution: The callback function from the queue is executed as soon as the call stack is empty, allowing the asynchronous task to be processed without blocking the main thread.
